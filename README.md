# Business Site

Second project on Technigo Bootcamp was about building a buisness site with a form and an accordian Q&A with help of javascript to make the answers show and hide. 

## The problem

I started this of with doing a skecth of what I wanted the site to look like on mobile and on desktop. Since it was a form I wanted it to be as easy to read and fill in as possible. I used flexbox to postion the form and the accordion in colum for mobile and row for desktop. 

If I had more time I would make more out of the accordion, add some symbols and animations. I would also do some fancy input in the form.
